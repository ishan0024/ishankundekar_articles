Efficient LLMs

1.0 Introduction:

In simple words, Large language models (LLMs) are a type of machine-learning neural network that are trained on immense data available, which helps them understand the human language and generate a response related to it. The most prominent example of a LLM is ChatGPT from OpenAI. If you wish to dive deep into what LLMs are and how they work, you can read one of my other articles “Gen AI and LLMs: In Depth”,this article will brief you upon every detail of LLMs and how to develop it. “Efficient LLMs” article particularly talks about how resource intensive LLMs are , the major problems of it and different solutions that can be incorporated to solve the problem. Let us try to understand why LLMs in general require heavy resources. OpenAI has released their latest Language Model which is “GPT-4.5”, this model represents a significant advancement in natural language processing, offering more human-like interactions and improved emotional intelligence. However, OpenAI has not publicly disclosed the exact number of parameters for GPT-4.5. For context, GPT-4 was estimated to have around 1.7 trillion parameters, a substantial increase from GPT-3's 175 billion parameters. This progression suggests that GPT-4.5 likely has a parameter count in the trillions, contributing to its enhanced capabilities. The improved performance comes with a price of increased size and complexity which leads to higher operational and computational costs. In resource-constrained organisations, such as academic labs or the medical industry, which lack access to the large computational capabilities of Tech Giants, the enormous resource requirements to train or implement such complex models might be overly expensive.

I would like to introduce a research paper “Cite here”, the authors of this paper carried out a survey on open and closed source LLMs to systematically address the challenges of high consumption of computational,memory,energy and financial resources by reviewing a broad spectrum of techniques designed to enhance resource efficient LLMs. Financial resources relate to the monetary investment required for infrastructure costs, memory includes the necessary data storage capacity, energy refers to the electricity used during operation, computation refers to the processing power required to train and run these models, and communication costs include the bandwidth and latency in data transfer during training and inference. A more efficient system is one that produces the same amount of output while using less resources,in this context, efficiency is defined as the ratio of these resources invested to the output generated. In order to provide more accessible and sustainable AI solutions, a resource-efficient LLM is made to optimise performance and capabilities while minimising resource cost across all of these aspects.

1.1 A systematic structure to solve this problem:

Figure 1: “Cite here” Structure to make LLMs efficient.

As we can see in “cite fig.1 ”, the authors of the paper “cite paper here” have proposed a systematic structure that categorizes the techniques for enhancing the resource efficiency of LLMs into clear, defined classes. These were all chosen because they are essential to the establishment and implementation of an effective LLM. In this article, I will try to introduce the different classes and subclasses of the techniques proposed by “cite paper here”.Later, I plan to introduce more volumes of this article where I will talk about each technique in a structured taxonomy so that we can understand which technique we need to choose for a particular use case.

2.0 How to make LLMs resource efficient?

Resource efficiency in LLMs can be very tricky and important at the same time. There are different challenges that we might come across and we need to outline these challenges with different key perspectives. As outlined in the paper “cite here”, I will simplify the challenges to have a better understanding :

Problems with different Models- Low parallelism in auto-regressive generation: The most common technique in LLMs, auto-regressive token generation, has slow computation because the model processes data sequentially rather than simultaneously. This leads to slow processing in both training and inference, and is particularly problematic for big model sizes or lengthy input lengths. Self-attention layers with quadratic complexity: The multi-head self-attention layer in LLMs has quadratic complexity in relation to the length of the input sequence. As the input length grows, this complexity causes a computing bottleneck which means the time to process the input increases which leads to delayed outputs. Theory about performance- Scaling laws and diminishing returns: According to theoretical understandings of scaling laws for neural networks, especially LLMs, the benefits in performance increase per additional parameter, decrease with increasing model size. So, in simple words as the model is scaled or more parameters are added the overall performance per parameter reduces.This situation calls into question the ideal LLM size as well as how to strike a balance between performance improvement and resource investment. Overfitting and generalisation: Theoretical research on machine learning generalisation is especially important to LLMs. To create more resource-efficient models, it is important to understand the boundaries of what big models can infer from training data and the dangers of overfitting. Overfitting is basically where the model performs very well on training data that it has already learned but performs poorly on unseen data. Constricted Systems- It is impossible to put LLMs into the memory of a single GPU/TPU because the model sizes are huge and have extensive training datasets. In order to maximize LLM training and complete a particular task, we have to design a complex system which is again a challenge in itself. The way in which the system is designed becomes even more important because LLMs need to respond quickly and handle large amounts of data efficiently. This is especially crucial for a smooth user experience while keeping costs under control. Data Privacy: Since we do not have access to the original data, it is challenging to apply certain techniques that could increase the efficiency of LLMs, many of which are trained using big, private datasets. Furthermore, a large number of these models are "closed source," which means that we are unable to view or modify their internal mechanisms. This limits research transparency and makes it more difficult to enhance them.

To make LLMs more effective and address the issues mentioned above has been the subject of extensive research in recent years. Although a lot of evolving ideas have been put out, yet the concept of "resource-efficient" LLMs is still relatively new. The majority of these techniques are made for particular purposes, the fundamental concepts can also be used in other contexts. However, because each of these techniques address a different use case, it is challenging to compare them across different parameters. It's also challenging to gauge how effectively these efficient models work because they take into account a variety of variables, including speed, memory, and energy consumption. Researchers and developers find it challenging to make sense of the advantages, disadvantages, and potential future developments for resource-efficient LLMs since there is currently no standardised method for evaluating these models. In this article, we try to understand the taxonomy proposed by “cite paper here” which addresses the issue of inefficient LLMs , and hopefully we can create LLMs that are resource efficient.

2.1 Architecture Design

This section looks at new ways to improve the design of LLMs, especially focusing on making Transformer models more efficient. Transformer-based models and non-transformer models are the two primary categories into which this category examines the fundamental structure of LLMs. 2.1.1 Transformer-based Architecture

Transformer-based architectures can be made resource-efficient by employing unique attention mechanisms and computational optimizations that minimise both time and memory complexity. By eliminating pointless calculations, methods like kernel-based approximations (KDEFormer) and locality-sensitive hashing (Reformer) maximize self-attention operations. Restructuring matrix multiplications to get near-linear complexity is another way that linear attention techniques, such as Linear Transformer and AFT, increase efficiency. Furthermore, to optimize throughput on GPUs, hardware-aware solutions such as FlashAttention and SageAttention make use of memory-efficient paging strategies and optimized CUDA kernels. Long-context processing without undue resource demands is made possible by techniques like LoMA and BiPE, which enhance memory compression and positional encoding for improved length extrapolation. Transformer-based designs can greatly increase their scalability and efficiency by incorporating these developments, which makes them more suitable for large-scale language model deployment in the real world.

2.1.2 Non-Transformer Architecture

Non-Transformer-based architectures can achieve resource efficiency by leveraging novel computational frameworks that reduce memory and processing overhead while maintaining competitive performance. Mixture of Experts (MoE) architectures, such as Switch Transformer and GLaM, employ sparse activation techniques to selectively activate only a subset of model parameters, significantly lowering computation costs compared to dense models. Similarly, RWKV integrates RNN-like sequential processing with Transformer-based training, optimizing memory usage and improving inference efficiency. Alternative models like Hyena and Mamba replace self-attention with structured convolutions and selective state-space models, respectively, leading to subquadratic scaling in sequence length while maintaining strong performance. Techniques such as MatMul-free LM further enhance efficiency by eliminating expensive matrix multiplications, reducing both memory footprint and energy consumption. Additionally, YOCO introduces a caching mechanism that minimizes redundant computations in long-context processing, enabling more efficient handling of large-scale language modeling tasks. By incorporating these innovations, non-Transformer architectures offer a compelling solution for developing LLMs that are computationally sustainable and scalable across diverse applications.

2.2 Pre-Training

Due to the size and complexity of large language models like GPT-4, it is critical to make the training process as efficient as possible. Efficiency involves more than simply speed, it also involves intelligent use of processing resources and efficient data management. Strong hardware, such as GPUs and TPUs, and clever strategies that enable several model components to be trained simultaneously are employed to do this. Additional techniques that can reduce expenses and speed up training include selecting the most useful data, streamlining the model, and using less memory. When combined, these tactics enable the development of sophisticated LLMs in a more cost-effective and useful manner.

2.2.1 Memory efficiency

Memory efficiency during pre-training can be significantly improved through advanced distributed training techniques and precision optimization strategies. Approaches such as ZeRO, Fairscale, and PaLM optimize memory utilization in data parallelism by partitioning model states, reducing redundant storage of parameters, gradients, and optimizer states across accelerators. Model parallelism further enhances efficiency by distributing computational loads across multiple GPUs, with Tensor Model Parallelism (TMP) dividing tensors for concurrent execution and Pipeline Model Parallelism (PMP) allocating layer groups to different accelerators. Techniques like GPipe and PipeDream refine PMP by introducing micro-batching, reducing idle time and improving resource utilization. Additionally, mixed precision training with FP16 and BF16 reduces memory overhead while maintaining numerical stability. The use of 16-bit floating-point numbers lowers memory consumption compared to traditional 32-bit or 64-bit training, accelerating computations without significant accuracy loss. BF16, in particular, mitigates precision degradation by optimizing exponent allocation, ensuring efficient large-scale training. By integrating these optimizations, memory-efficient pre-training enables scalable LLM development while minimizing hardware constraints and computational costs.

2.2.2 Dataset Selection Efficiency

Improving data efficiency during pre-training is crucial for making large language models (LLMs) more resource-efficient. One effective approach is smart data selection, where the model focuses on learning from the most useful and informative examples instead of processing every piece of data equally. This technique, known as “Importance Sampling”, helps the model prioritize higher-quality information, reducing unnecessary computation and speeding up training. Instead of wasting resources on redundant or low-value data, the model learns more effectively from a smaller, well-curated dataset. Another strategy is “Data Augmentation”, which involves creating slightly altered versions of existing data to make the most out of what’s already available. By generating additional training examples from a limited dataset, models can improve their performance without requiring massive amounts of new data. This approach is especially useful when high-quality training data is scarce or expensive to obtain. Additionally, choosing the right “Training Objectives” ,such as selectively skipping certain parts of data during processing can also make pre-training more efficient by reducing the workload without compromising the model’s learning ability.By integrating these techniques, LLMs can be trained more efficiently, using fewer resources while still maintaining high performance. This makes AI more accessible and sustainable, benefiting organizations that may not have the extensive computing power of tech giants.

2.3 Fine-Tuning Fine-tuning LLMs like GPT-4 for specific tasks requires a careful balance between improving performance and using resources efficiently. Since these models are large and require a lot of computing power, this section looks at different ways to fine-tune them while keeping costs and energy use in check.One approach is “parameter-efficient fine-tuning”, which only adjusts a small part of the model, making it a more resource-friendly option. Another method is “full-parameter fine-tuning” , where all parts of the model are modified, but this requires much more computing power.Understanding these fine-tuning strategies helps improve LLMs while managing their high computational demands.

2.3.1 Parameter Efficient Fine Tuning
Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) is a crucial technique for making large language models (LLMs) more resource-efficient by reducing the number of parameters that need to be updated during training. Instead of fine-tuning the entire model—which can be computationally expensive and memory-intensive—PEFT methods selectively modify only the most relevant parts of the model, significantly cutting down on processing power and storage requirements. One approach is to update only a small subset of the model’s parameters while keeping the rest unchanged. This method ensures that the model adapts to new tasks without requiring excessive computational resources. Another strategy is to introduce lightweight adapter layers between existing model layers, fine-tuning only these additional components while keeping the core model intact. This drastically reduces the number of trainable parameters, leading to faster fine-tuning with lower memory usage. Additionally, techniques like LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) optimize fine-tuning even further by identifying and modifying only the most impactful parts of the model, ensuring efficiency without sacrificing performance. By leveraging these techniques, organizations can fine-tune LLMs for specific applications with minimal resource consumption, making AI more accessible even for those without vast computing power. These innovations help strike a balance between model adaptability and efficiency, ensuring that fine-tuning remains practical and cost-effective.

2.3.2 Full Parameter Fine Tuning
To make Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) resource-efficient during the fine-tuning of Large Language Models (LLMs), several approaches can be considered that optimize the use of computational and memory resources without sacrificing model performance. One key advantage of PEFT is that it updates only a small subset of parameters, which significantly reduces the training cost compared to full-parameter fine-tuning. This efficient use of parameters makes PEFT more resource-friendly, especially in environments with constrained GPU memory and processing power. Since PEFT methods, such as LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation), focus on tuning only a limited number of parameters, they demand much less GPU memory, making it feasible to train large models with smaller memory footprints. As a result, PEFT can be a more viable option for training large-scale LLMs, particularly in resource-constrained settings. In addition to the inherent advantages of PEFT in terms of reduced memory consumption, several optimization techniques can further enhance its resource efficiency. For instance, combining PEFT with memory optimization strategies like Gradient Checkpointing or the use of more efficient optimizers like Zero Redundancy Optimizer (ZeRO) can help mitigate the challenges of limited GPU memory. These techniques ensure that intermediate results are stored efficiently during training, reducing memory usage while maintaining performance. Furthermore, combining PEFT with techniques like FlashAttention can also speed up training by enabling faster computations with lower memory overhead. By leveraging these optimization methods, PEFT allows for the fine-tuning of large models, such as 30B or 65B parameter models, on machines with limited memory, thus making it a powerful, scalable solution for efficient fine-tuning of LLMs.

2.4 Inference

Inference in LLMs, like the GPT series, is the stage where the model is used to generate text, answer questions, or perform other tasks based on what it has learned. Since these models are huge and complex, making the inference process more efficient is important. This section looks at different ways to improve the speed and reduce the memory needed for inference, while still getting high-quality results. These methods include model compression techniques, like pruning [removing unnecessary parts of the model] and quantization [making the model smaller], as well as dynamic inference techniques that adjust how much computing power is used based on the input. These approaches are essential for using LLMs in real-life situations where both limited resources and high performance are important.

2.4.1 Model Compression

To make model compression during LLM inference more resource-efficient, several techniques focus on reducing the computational load and memory usage while maintaining the model's performance. Pruning is one of the key approaches, where certain parameters or weights in the model are removed to create a smaller, more efficient version of the model. Unstructured pruning, for example, eliminates specific weights based on criteria like magnitude, reducing the model's complexity without altering its overall structure. While this can make the model sparse, it requires specialized compression techniques for efficient storage and computation. Innovations like “SparseGPT” have shown that unstructured pruning can reduce parameters by up to 60% without significantly affecting performance, making it suitable for large-scale LLMs that require rapid deployment. On the other hand, “Structured Pruning” offers a more hardware-friendly solution by removing entire groups of weights, such as neurons or attention heads, rather than individual weights. This approach results in a more uniform model with reduced size and improved inference speed, making it more suitable for deployment on resource-constrained hardware. Techniques like “LLM-Pruner” and “LoSparse” leverage structured pruning by identifying key weight groups for removal and ensuring that the model retains essential features. Additionally, contextual pruning introduces dynamic sparsity by adjusting the model's parameters based on the input, which allows for faster inference times without sacrificing accuracy. This method, coupled with hardware-optimized systems like “Deja Vu”, helps accelerate LLM inference in real-time environments, ultimately making model compression during LLM inference more resource-efficient. These strategies ensure that LLMs can perform well in practical applications, even with limited computational resources.

2.4.2 Dynamic Acceleration
Dynamic acceleration during inference is a crucial technique for making LLMs faster and more efficient without compromising their performance. One way to achieve this is by allowing the model to “Exit Early” when it is confident in its predictions. Instead of running through all layers every time, the model can decide to stop processing earlier for simpler inputs, significantly reducing the time and resources needed for inference. This approach ensures that complex inputs still receive the necessary computation, while straightforward ones don’t waste extra processing power. Another strategy involves “Pruning Unnecessary Information” during inference. Just as humans skim through text and focus only on the most important parts, LLMs can learn to ignore less relevant words or data points. This selective processing reduces the amount of work the model needs to do, speeding up responses while lowering memory usage. Additionally, newer techniques allow LLMs to predict multiple words at once instead of generating them one at a time, making responses much faster without changing the quality of the output. By integrating these dynamic acceleration techniques, LLMs can generate responses more quickly and efficiently, reducing computational costs and making them more practical for real-world applications. These improvements are particularly valuable for businesses and researchers who need AI-powered tools that can run smoothly on limited hardware without sacrificing speed or accuracy.

2.5 System Design

Optimizing LLMs like GPT for efficient performance, especially in resource-limited environments, requires careful system design. Key strategies include “Hardware Offloading”, which distributes computing tasks across different storage and processing units, and “Collaborative Inference”, where multiple systems share resources to enhance processing power. Additionally, adapting LLMs for “Edge Devices”, such as smartphones, ensures they can function efficiently outside of powerful data centers. These approaches help improve speed, reduce energy use, and make LLMs more scalable across different applications.

2.5.1 Deployment Optimization Deployment optimization plays a key role in making large language models (LLMs) more resource-efficient, especially when running them on devices with limited computing power. One effective approach is “Hardware Offloading”, where parts of the model that are not immediately needed are temporarily moved to slower but larger storage spaces, such as a computer’s main memory or even a hard drive. This allows the most important computations to happen on the high-speed processors (like GPUs) while keeping memory usage under control. However, since constantly moving data back and forth can slow things down, smart offloading strategies help ensure that only the necessary parts of the model are quickly brought back when needed, minimizing delays. Another strategy is “Collaborative Inference”, where multiple users or systems share the computing load instead of relying on a single device. Think of it like teamwork where each participant handles a small part of the task, reducing the strain on any one machine and making the system more efficient overall. This approach is especially useful for smaller devices like personal computers or smartphones, allowing them to access the power of large AI models without requiring expensive hardware upgrades. By combining these techniques, LLMs can be deployed more efficiently, making them faster, less expensive to run, and more accessible to a wider range of users. This ensures that even businesses and researchers with limited resources can take advantage of advanced AI without being held back by hardware constraints.

2.5.2 Support Infrastructure
Support infrastructure plays a vital role in ensuring that large language models (LLMs) run efficiently while keeping resource costs under control. One way to achieve this is by using optimized software frameworks that help manage the massive computational demands of these models. Libraries like DeepSpeed and Megatron-LM are designed to make AI training and deployment more efficient by breaking down complex tasks and distributing them across multiple processing units. This allows LLMs to operate smoothly without overwhelming a single computer or server, making large-scale AI more accessible. Another key approach is deploying LLMs on “Edge Devices”, such as smartphones and smaller computers, rather than relying solely on powerful data centers. This is made possible by techniques that shrink model size and reduce memory use, ensuring that AI-powered applications can run directly on personal devices. Additionally, “Cloud-Based and Hybrid Solutions” allow models to share workloads between local devices and remote servers, balancing performance and cost. By leveraging these strategies, organizations can reduce hardware expenses, lower energy consumption, and enable AI to run efficiently even in environments with limited computing power. By building a strong and resource-conscious support infrastructure, AI systems can be deployed in a way that is both cost-effective and scalable, allowing businesses, researchers, and everyday users to access advanced LLMs without excessive resource demands
